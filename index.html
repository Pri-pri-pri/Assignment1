      <h2>Chicken Vindaloo</h2>
      <p>
        “Vindaloo” is a popular Indian
        <a id="curryDish" href="">curry dish</a> that calls for meat to be
        marinated in a highly flavorful spicy mixture with vinegar, then quickly
        cooked up when you’re ready to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this dish has a long list of spices, most are quite common in the
        average spice rack. If you find you're missing one, it's not a deal
        breaker. You will still have a lovely, fragrant curry.
